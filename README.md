TerrariaMod is a mod that attempts to port over as much content from the game Terraria into Minecraft. It adds several new things from the game including items, tools, and a few bosses.

For builds on 1.18, if your wanting to use colored lighting you will need to download a release from here until my pull request for the update is merged https://github.com/Ryorama/colored-lights/releases/tag/v1.0.3
